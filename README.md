# Zeet Golang test

  

## Requirement

- Fix broken repo so it can be deployed on Zeet

- Add a feature to the now working project

## Specifications

1.  Fork the Github repo, and deploy it as a project on the Zeet team.  
    
2.  Fix anything that needs to be fixed, so that by the end you have an endpoint that you can open in your browser that responds with {"page": "home"}  
    
3.  Make it so that if I go to {url}/hello/johnny, it responds with {"page": "hello", "hello": "johnny"}  
    
4.  for bonus points, add some UI so it's not just a JSON response (not required)

## Solution
